## Question 6
*Start with the weather data from the `nycflights13` package. Select all the variables related to temperature, humidity, and precipitation, and pick out the key and index variables. Have a look at your data, and write a small description of the time series you observe.*

## Question 7
*Change the weather data into a tsibble.*

## Question 8
*Add a year and month column to your weather data, and create a basic line plot which shows the temperature data from each airport over time. Have a think back to what you learned in visualisation week, and think about whether plotting the whole time series in one go is adequate here? Write down your suggestions for what could be done to make a better and more informative plot.*

## Question 9
*Choose an appropriate rolling window and calculate a moving average for your weather temperature data for each airport origin. Create a useful plot which overlays the original time series data and the rolling average data. Make sure the graph is easy for others to understand.*

*Finally, write a summary of why you chose the time window you did, and describe any trends you see.*

## Question 10
*Downsample your data so that you plot daily temperature data for each airport, instead of hourly data.*

## Question 11
*Decompose your daily time series data (the downsampled one) using an appopriate downsampling technique. Justify your choice, and explain what the decomposition shows you. Does it tell you anything about the seasonality that you couldnâ€™t see before?*

## Question 12
*Extract features from your downsampled data. Which airport has the strongest trend?*

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
